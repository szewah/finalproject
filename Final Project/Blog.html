			<h2>Piece by Piece</h2>

		</div>
		
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>A wine-red onion sits half peeled. Snapshots of a film opening and an award ceremony on the screen, scraps of paper scatter the table, a pair of socks occupies a corner of the sofa, envelopes lie half opened on a coffee table. Upstairs, a cabinet full of files, needs to be sorted properly.</p>

			<p>From the outside, the scene is of an ordinary living room of an ordinary middle-class family.But if there were an emergency, would we know from all these pieces what their life is?</p>
	

			<p>The cabinet is an obvious place to start. There are bank statements, paid bills and tax returns. What of unwritten arrangements and systems? Could all the information be in that little book that the owner scribbles words in? But where is that book?</p>


			<p>When my mother had her accident, I scrambled to understand the country she was in and her day-to-day dealings. I knew I had to get to the hospital but I was confused by all the personnel who would check in.</p> 

			<p>There was the duty doctor, her gerontologist, the physical therapist, the speech therapist, the occupational therapist and the social worker. There were papers to sign, a daily journal to keep and the meals and bed changers. </p>

			<p>(This is second nature to people who have grown up in Los Angeles and who have spent a lot of time in hospital. Up until then, my medical interactions have been confined to a GP, a dentist and if pushing it, a specialist.)</p> 

			<p>Then there were the gardener, cleaner and handyman. I had to sort out who was paid upfront and how much. But first, I needed to find out their contact details. The information sat in my mother's head so instead, I skipped back home at the times they were meant to be around and asked them.</p>

			<p>Back then, I relied on the kindness of strangers to do the right thing and help me. In reality, I should have shown an interest in my parent's life and how they ran it. What would have been the right time to start learning? Anytime.</p>
